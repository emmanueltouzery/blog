--------------  ------------------------------------------------------------

Passionate software developer, who loves solving problems and build software that
helps people and companies. From the moment I learned how to program, I would
always study different technologies at home than at work or at school, enjoying 
the challenge and trying to stay ahead of the curve. For a long time that was ruby,
these days it's with haskell and lisp-based languages. 
I also played with OpenGL, my raspberry pi and wrote various android apps for my
phone through time. I also like to think I'm a good team player, whether in
cooperation with my peers, or mentoring of junior developers. 

I have a strong experience in communicating with customers, 
preparing specifications, leading projects to their completion and supporting them.

## Experience

### Senior software engineer - LIT Transit - Jan 2013 → Current

<span class="tech-tag">hibernate</span> <span class="tech-tag">postgresql</span> 
<span class="tech-tag">angularjs</span> <span class="tech-tag">html5</span>
<span class="tech-tag">spacemacs</span> <span class="tech-tag">linux</span>
<span class="tech-tag">android</span>

LIT Transit (Ljubljana, Slovenia) develops public transit solutions for 
customers around the world. I got to cooperate in particular with customers in
Singapore. I was responsible for the writing of specifications, work effort 
estimates, implementation and supervision of some other team members.
I participated in the implementation and maintenance of several bigger software
projects and also multiple side-projects. My main area of expertise is the
backend, but I did implement several important android projects and do a fair
amount of frontend work.

### Software engineer - Regulussoft d.o.o. - Jan 2002 → Jan 2013 (11 years)

<span class="tech-tag">mysql</span> <span class="tech-tag">java</span>
<span class="tech-tag">jdevelop</span>

Regulussoft (Ljubljana, Slovenia) is a smaller software development company 
developing solutions for third parties. I had the opportunity to work with 
numerous customers and technologies through the years. My experience mixed 
longer, multi-year, projects, with shorter multi-month ones. In a smaller
company, I could develop my self-initiative and flexibility. I could also get
exposition to many different technologies through that time (windows CE, symbian,
palm, android, windows, linux, java, .NET, even a bit PHP, and so on).


## Education

### Masters of Science, National University of Ireland, Maynooth (2001)

Final year of studies in Ireland through the ERASMUS student exchange program.
Obtained a MSc from Maynooth as well as the engineering degree from Telecom Nancy.

### Software engineer, Telecom Nancy, France (1999-2001)

Software engineering school in three years (admission after two years of 
Higher School Preparatory Classes in France). Last year through the ERASMUS 
programme. Gave me a solid theoretical and practical base on the technical side,
together with a preparation to practical enterprise work.
The second year internship was in the LORIA research institution.

## OSS projects I've written or contributed to

I've authored or contributed to a series of OSS projects, mostly in
<span class="tech-tag">haskell</span>, <span class="tech-tag">typescript</span>,
and <span class="tech-tag">java</span>.

### Functional programming

I'm the author of [prelude.ts](https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/prelude.ts), 
which is a  typescript library aiming to make functional programming concepts
accessible and productive in typescript.
It provides immutable & persistent collections such as a vector, set and map, and
functional control constructs like option/maybe and either.

I have made [significant contributions](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr/commits?author=emmanueltouzery)
to the [vavr](https://github.com/vavr-io/vavr) java project, which is an 
object-functional language extension to Java 8.

### Parsing & Interoperability

I also wrote [hsexif](https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/hsexif), a haskell
library which parses EXIF information from JPEG and RAW files.

I have made [significant contributions](https://github.com/jpvillaisaza/slack-web/commits?author=emmanueltouzery)
to and am co-maintaining [slack-web](https://github.com/jpvillaisaza/slack-web), which
is a modern haskell library offering bindings to the [slack team
messaging](http://www.slack.com) web API.

### Angular type-checking

I wrote [ng-typeview](https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/ng-typeview), which enables
type-checking of angular1 views when you use typescript with angularjs. ng-typeview
parses HTML views and javascript/typescript controllers and directives, and enables
type-checking of the views against your typescript.

### GUI applications

I wrote [projectpad](https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/projectpad), a haskell
application using QML for its GUI and [SQLCipher](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/),
a SQLite extension offering encryption for data storage, to manage secret 
credentials and server information.

I also wrote [cigale-timesheet](https://github.com/emmanueltouzery/cigale-timesheet),
which is a haskell application using [bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
and [reflex](https://github.com/reflex-frp/reflex) for its GUI. That application collects
data from various sources (source control, chats, emails, calendar, bugtracking software)
to help the user prepare a timesheet of the tasks he or she has been performing.
